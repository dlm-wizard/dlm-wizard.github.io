英文解码不会出现乱码，各种编码方式都兼容 ASCII 码，具体请看[关于 URL 编码](http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2010/02/url_encoding.html)。URI 路径中尽量不要出现中文!

> 不显示控制字符

在 java 程序中通过 `char/16：UTF-16 描述 Unicode 值「16进制」对应的字符`，在文本中加入控制「空白」字符。

## expression（表达式）

JavaScript 中 IIFE（立即执行函数）

> An expression in a programming language is a combination of explicit values, constants, variables, operators, and functions that are interpreted according to the particular rules of precedence and of association for a particular programming language, which computes and then produces (returns, in a stateful environment) another value. This process, like for mathematical expressions, is called evaluation. The value can be of various types, such as numerical, string, and logical.

## Statement（语句）

> In computer programming, a statement is a syntactic unit of an imperative programming language that expresses some action to be carried out. A program written in such a language is formed by a sequence of one or more statements. A statement may have internal components (e.g., expressions).
